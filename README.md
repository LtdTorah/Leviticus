# Leviticus
Leviticus (“Vayikra”) is the third book of the Torah. It primarily delineates the details of sacrificial worship in the Mishkan (Tabernacle), a temporary and portable sanctuary built to serve God in the desert. It also discusses impurity and purification, Yom Kippur, the festivals, forbidden relationships, dietary laws, and various ethical and agricultural laws. Though its topics are diverse, the book is unified by the theme of holiness in people, time, and space.
